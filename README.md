# Getting Started with User Book APP

This project was bootstrapped with `ReactJS` and all the routes has been integrated with `react-router-dom`. For front-end design I have used `React Bootstrap`. For icons I have used `react-icons`. Api calling with `axios` is used to fetch data and render them in the UI. `Spinner` has been used in case there is delay in the response from API and loader has been used so that DOM rendering doesn't get effected. `Search` feature is integrated to make it easier to look up for a specific user from user list and show the details in the outlet.
